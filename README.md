I am so proud of myself as, doing this project I use a lot of our practice in class but also just trying to remember how I put the functions in CodePen. A lot of the demoing in class recently has been helping me a lot to understand vue and understand JS a bit more too!

I struggled with making it work on GitHub pages where I had to ask people/Ashlyn to figure out how do I get it to work on GitHub pages and not have a 404. = Resolved. The issue was the file within the file so I was able to resolve it so I can push it to Vercel.

The 2 components I did was Main.vue and Header.Vue. I tried to just do a button but it seemed to break it easily so I decided to do the button in the header and still use header.vue to hold the header image, text and button.
